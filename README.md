This a 7-round 128-bit Feistel Cipher I have designed as part of the Applied Cryptography course under Dr. Chester Rebeiro's tutelage. The introduction to the problem statement was framed quite well in the MtoQ document. This gave me the right motivation and enthusiasm to go on.

In the course, this was a 3 part submission due in March 2017. You can check my submission formats and the corresponding writeups required in the ![Submissions](/Submissions) folder. If you want the final result, you can check the encrypt and decrypt files along with linear and differential analyses of the s-boxes.

My presentation on the cipher is also present.
