I am doing this assignment alone

Files Attached:-
----------------

1. linear1.cpp , linear2.cpp , linear3.cpp , linear4.cpp - These are the c++ code I wrote for finding the maximum bias and also the linear approximation tables for the new sboxes. Using these I answered the question 11.
2. differential1.cpp , differential2.cpp , differential3.cpp , differential4.cpp - These are the c++ files I wrote for finding the maximum bias for differential cryptanalysis.
3. lin_approx_table_1.txt , lin_approx_table_2.txt , lin_approx_table_3.txt , lin_approx_table_4.txt - These are the linear approximation table printed into a file for each sbox.
4. diff_table_1.txt , diff_table_2.txt , diff_table_3.txt , diff_table_4.txt - These are the files which contain the maximum bias information in case of differential cryptanalysis.
5. mtoq2.pdf - This is the report answering the section 2.
